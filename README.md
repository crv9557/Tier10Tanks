# Tier10Tanks
The goal of this program is to track the highest tier tanks in the video game "World of Tanks". The game consists of historical tanks from World War I all the way to the Vietnam War, organized by tier, with a total of 10 tiers.  The tanks that this program will document are at the top tier (Tier 10). The qualities that will be documented are the many components of the tank, which includes the gun, turret, engine, and radio. Each of these components have values that could be pulled out of the program that helps a person understand how the tank functions in the game.
