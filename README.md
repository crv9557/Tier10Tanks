# Tier10Tanks
The goal of this program is to track the highest tier tanks in the video game "World of Tanks". The game consists of historical tanks from World War I all the way to the Vietnam War, organized by tier, with a total of 10 tiers.  The tanks that this program will document are at the top tier (Tier 10). The qualities that will be documented are the many components of the tank, which includes the gun, turret, engine, and radio. Each of these components have values that could be pulled out of the program that helps a person understand how the tank functions in the game.

Filter: For now, it runs on the "Weight" data, searching for anything that is more than 50 tons and less than 60 tons.

Map: As this is a video game with active players, sometimes players will make it very clear to the developers that some tanks are outright too good or too bad for them to be played in a fair fight. To counteract this, this game undergoes repeated updates that change the numerical values in order to create a sense of balance. My map function will basically act like this: an update to the game. I won't change their names or how many are present, but I will change what their values are.

Reduce: My goal is to simply have the program use the "Name" data to pinpoint a certain tank and its values.
